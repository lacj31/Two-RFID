This is based on the code provided by Erivando Sena @ https://github.com/erivandoramos/TwoRC522RPi

I have modified it to display the Tag IDS when they are present. 


Two RFID readers with Raspberry Pi

Assuming the python-dev and SPI-Py libraries are already correctly installed, configured, and tested on Raspberry Pi.

Otherwise, here is a brief help:
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
$ sudo apt-get install python-dev
$ git clone https://github.com/lthiery/SPI-Py.git
$ cd SPI-Py
$ sudo python setup.py install
```

Use: 
```
run the command "python g_read_two_RFID.py" in the root folder of the extracted files
```
Press Ctrl + C to finish.
